        <h2>Ferrari SF90 Spider to be unveiled on December 12</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Ferrari is set to unveil a new model on November 12. It is likely to be the SF90 Spider. Ferrari’s first plug-in
            hybrid supercar – the SF90 Stradale was revealed last year. A Spider version has been in the works for sometime.
            In fact, prototypes have also been spotted on the streets. The car could make its debut in a couple of days. The
            SF90 Spider will share its underpinnings with the coupe. Under the skin, it will have the same complicated
            powertrain as well. Speaking of the engine, the SF90 Stradale uses a 4.0-liter, twin-turbo V8 that produces 769
            hp and 590 lb-ft of torque.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The internal combustion engine is assisted by two electric motors mounted at the front and one at the rear adding
            another 217 hp for a combined output of 986 hp. The electric motors are powered by a 7.9 kWh lithium-ion battery
            that offers 16 miles of all-electric range. The powertrain is hooked up to a 8-speed dual-clutch transmission.
            Ferrari claims that the coupe will do 0-62 mph in 2.5 seconds. 0-124 mph comes up in just 6.7 seconds, while the
            top speed if rated at 212 mph. While the coupe weighs 1570 kg, the SF90 Spider could be slightly heavier.

        <h2>$19 Million Bugatti Convertable La Voiture Noire: First Prototype is ready!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
        <p class="paragraph">
            It was the 2019 Geneva Motor Show when Bugatti revealed to the world one of the most expensive one-offs every built
            – La Voiture Noire. It was just a design concept back then. Now though, the first prototype is ready. For the first
            time since its unveiling, the La Voiture Noire has been spotted at a Bugatti R&D facility. The car looks exactly like
            the show car, except if you look closely, you will notice a slightly different engine cover. While the show car had
            two horizontal slots just below the roof, the prototype seems to have a pair slots just above the rear spoiler as
            well. Otherwise, the striking LED tail lamps are similar to the concept.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the images don’t reveal the exhaust setup on the prototype. I’m sure you know why we’re interested
            in that. The concept car had a bank of 6 exhausts arranged above the rear diffuser. We hope to see the same on
            the actual road car. According to a source, this isn’t the final prototype. Therefore, you will be able to spot
            a few parts borrowed from the Chiron. The wheels being one of them.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            La Voiture Noire was conceived as a tribute to Jean Bugatti’s Type 57SC Atlantic. The car is powered by the same
            16-cylinder engine that powers the Chiron. The 8-liter W16 develops 1,500 hp and 1180 lb-ft of torque.For the first
            time since its unveiling, the La Voiture Noire has been spotted at a Bugatti R&D facility. The car looks exactly like

        <h2>Hennessey Venom F5 to be Unveiled before the end of 2020</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            According John Hennessey, Covid-19 has delayed the unveiling of the production-spec Venom F5. The 300 mph Venom
            F5 was initially scheduled to debut sometime this month. However, the pandemic has played spoilsport just as it
            did with so many other exciting launches this year. While chatting with Tim Bravo on the DRIVE ON podcast, John
            said that the plan was to showcase the first production car at Pebble Beach this year. But, as you know, the
            show was cancelled due to the pandemic. While John didn’t give a specific date, he did mention that the car will
            be revealed before the end of this year.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            John Hennessey also talked about the overall progress of the project. He said that the first car is nearly
            complete. The engine has been bolted in and it’s now in running condition. Once the first production Venom F5 is
            ready and revealed to the world, it will enter the testing phase in early 2021. The Venom F5 is one of the few
            hypercars that could beat the top speed record set by the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. It is powered by a
            7.6-liter twin-turbo V8 that makes 1817 hp and 1193 lb-ft of torque. Hennessey is aiming to achieve 311 mph.
        </p><br>

            few weeks ago, the SSC Tuatara allegedly set a new top speed record which led to a massive controversy. Here’s
            what John Hennessey had to say about that. While chatting with Tim Bravo on the DRIVE ON podcast, John
            said that the plan was to showcase the first production car at Pebble Beach this year. But, as you know, the
